# 🧠 Indie Maker Notes — Note-taking framework for indie makers

**Indie Maker Notes** is a note-taking framework and concept designed to help **indie makers, coders, entrepreneurs, and creative people** organize their thoughts, projects, and knowledge — *without the pain*.

Built with ❤️ in [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md) and structured for clarity, this system helps you **capture ideas, connect them meaningfully, and retrieve them effortlessly**.

> Think of it as a second brain for people who build, learn, and share online.

## ✨ Why Indie Maker Notes?

As makers, we juggle a lot:

- Projects and client work  
- Books, articles, and videos we learn from  
- Social media planning and content creation  
- Newsletters

This system brings all of that **into one connected place**

## 🗂 Folder Structure Overview

| Folder | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| 📚 **Bibliography** | Notes and quotes from what you read, watch, or listen to (books, videos, podcasts). |
| 🧩 **Knowledge** | Your own thoughts and interpretations. Link these to bibliography notes to build connections. |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Contacts** | Notes about people you work or meet with — useful when linking to meeting notes. |

| 🧱 **Projects** | Everything related to a specific project: goals, notes, and linked tasks. |
| ✅ **Tasks** | Your global task list. Tasks can be filtered by project, status, priority, or category. |
| ✍️ **Newsletter** | Where you write and prepare your newsletters or blog posts. |
| 💭 **Draft** | A quick-capture space for raw thoughts or ideas to process later. |

## 🧠 Core Note Types

### 1. Bibliography Notes

Where you capture insights from external sources.  
Ask yourself:  
*What did the author say?*  
*What did I learn from it?*  

Keep only what’s useful — not everything.

---

### 2. Knowledge Notes

Where your *own thinking* happens.  
Build arguments, connections, and interpretations.  
Sometimes, you’ll even disagree with your sources — that’s perfect.

---

### 3. Meeting Notes

For every meeting or client discussion:

- Add metadata: duration, attendees, related project  
- Link to related contacts or project notes  

---

### 4. Project Notes

Each project has its own note with:

- Goals, links, and metadata  
- Related meetings and tasks  
- Optional embedded views or dashboards  

---

### 5. Tasks

Tasks live in a central folder but link to specific projects.  
Metadata examples (as plain text):

Project: [[Project Name]]  
Status: In Progress  
Priority: High  
Type: feature | bug | enhancement  
Category: frontend | backend | marketing  
Duration: 2h  

---

### 6. Draft

A safe space for chaos — capture now, organize later.  
Keep it clean, but don’t let perfection stop your flow.
